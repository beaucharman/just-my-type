Tag references from the awesome MDN. Images from Lorempixel.

A pretty wicked tool to use during and after CSS development is Harry Roberts' [debug.scss](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/blob/master/generic/_debug.scss), which is a part of the [Inuit CSS framework](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css).

### Todo

- Add in an actual checklist system.

### Usage

1) Grab the HTML and CSS from the `just-my-type.html` file and place it in a page of you project.

3) Go ahead and check all your styles against the various HTML elements!
